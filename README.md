# IceFire-SecureDoorLock

At first I encoded my name using ASCII char codes (not exact codes, but with rotation) and created an ArrayList.
Secondly I created a another list where I added encoded input.
If those 2 Lists are equal then the code randomly choose a person from whitelist and replaces firstName and lastName with chosen names.
And that's how my code works!
